Loc is a web tool that loads a folder from your local file system and tabulates files and the line count inside them.

It is possible to fine-tune the considered files using glob pattern syntax.
You can easily copy and paste the data on your spreadsheet software to further your analysis or estimates.

The app uses the secure File System API and does not send data from your machine. Everything is done right in your browser.

The source code is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joaomelo/loc). You can check it or even download and run it locally. The site is hosted in the same infrastructure using GitHub Pages.
