Loc is a web tool that loads a folder from your local file system and tabulates files and the line count inside them.

It is possible to fine-tune the considered files using glob pattern syntax.
You can easily copy and paste the data on your spreadsheet software to further your analysis or estimates.

The app uses the secure File System API and does not collect data from your files. Everything is done right in your browser.

You can download the source code here and run the app locally. There is also an instance available [loc.melo.plus](https://loc.melo.plus)
